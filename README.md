# 0-hello-world Instructions

A common technique used by programmers when learning a new language or technique is to do something in a very basic way and call it "hello world".

In this assignment introduces github and journaling for this course.

To complete this assignment:
    
1. Open up your favorite note taking app or website and create a new note. If you don't have a favorite, Microsoft Word, Notepad, or TextEdit will work just fine.

    >>Take all the notes you need to help get through the content and concepts presented this week. You do not need to change your normal note taking style for this assignment.

1. At the bottom of your notes, add a section called "Reflections"
1. Here, you'll write out two lists. One for the things you understand most confidently, and another for the things you are struggling with. 

    >>The items in these lists can be vocabulary, tasks, concepts, whatever sticks out in your mind. Try to find at least two items per list and feel free to make them as long as you like. I will use these lists to check in with you next week on Slack.

1. Visit https://github.com/ITP-175-FA18/0-hello-world-`yourusername` to visit the repository you cloned earlier.
1. Click the `Create new file` button on this page and name it `journal.md`.
1. In `journal.md ` paste in the two lists from your notes.
1. Scroll down and you'll see a section called `Commit new file`. In the smaller textbox type, `create journal.md` and select the Commit directly to the `master` branch option.

    >>On github, a commit is like hitting save and  upload button. We'll learn more about version control soon.
    
1. Click the green `Commit new file` button.
