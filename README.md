# 0-hello-world Journal

A common technique used by programmers when learning a new language or technique is to do something in a very basic way and call it "hello world".

This assignment will be our first experience with github and journaling for this course.

To complete this assignment:
    
1. Open up your favorite note taking app or website and create a new note. If you don't have a favorite, Microsoft Word, Notepad, or TextEdit will work just fine.

    >>Take all the notes you need to help get through the content and concepts presented this week. You do not need to change your normal note taking style for this assignment.

1. At the bottom of your notes, add a section called "Reflections"
1. Here, you'll write out two lists. One for the things you understand most confidently, and another for the things you are struggling with. 

    >>The items in these lists can be vocabulary, tasks, concepts, whatever sticks out in your mind. Try to find at least two items per list and feel free to make them as long as you like. I will use these lists to check in with you next week on Slack.

1. Visit [https://github.com](https://github.com) 
1. Create a new file in your text editor named `hello.md`.
1. In `hello.md` write, `Hello, my name is ______` and fill in the blank with your name.

Submit the assignment [following these instructions].
